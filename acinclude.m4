#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AC_PROG_SWIG([major.minor.micro])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro searches for a SWIG installation on your system. If
#   found you should call SWIG via $(SWIG). You can use the optional
#   first argument to check if the version of the available SWIG is
#   greater than or equal to the value of the argument. It should have
#   the format: N[.N[.N]] (N is a number between 0 and 999. Only the
#   first N is mandatory.)
#
#   If the version argument is given (e.g. 1.3.17), AC_PROG_SWIG checks
#   that the swig package is this version number or higher.
#
#   In configure.in, use as:
#
#     AC_PROG_SWIG(1.3.17)
#     SWIG_ENABLE_CXX
#     SWIG_MULTI_MODULE_SUPPORT
#     SWIG_PYTHON

#   SWIG_PYTHON([use-shadow-classes = {no, yes}])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Checks for Python and provides the $(SWIG_PYTHON_CPPFLAGS), and
#   $(SWIG_PYTHON_OPT) output variables.
#
#   $(SWIG_PYTHON_OPT) contains all necessary SWIG options to generate
#   code for Python. Shadow classes are enabled unless the value of the
#   optional first argument is exactly 'no'. If you need multi module
#   support (provided by the SWIG_MULTI_MODULE_SUPPORT macro) use
#   $(SWIG_PYTHON_LIBS) to link against the appropriate library. It
#   contains the SWIG Python runtime library that is needed by the type
#   check system for example.
