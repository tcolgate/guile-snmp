Guile-SNMP
==========

  Guile SNMP is a wrapper for the Net-SNMP libraries. it is intended
to provide a basic wrapper for direct useage of the Net-SNMP libraries
from Guile and an easy to use dialect of Scheme targeted at easier
SNMP reporting.

  The intial development was inspired by Yves Perrenoud's
( <yves@xpand.org>) work on yapsnmp.
